# 🌾 AI-Powered Crop Residue & Stubble Burning Alternative Advisor

## 📌 Overview
Stubble burning is a serious environmental, health, and agricultural issue, especially in India. Farmers often burn crop residue due to time constraints, lack of awareness, and limited access to affordable alternatives.

This project provides an **AI-powered advisory system** that helps farmers **avoid stubble burning** by recommending **profitable and sustainable alternatives** such as composting, biochar, pelletization, and residue selling.

The system is built using **Streamlit** and integrates **economic analysis, soil health impact, buyer discovery, government subsidies, and voice assistance** to support informed decision-making.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Crop residue burning causes severe air pollution (PM2.5, smog)
- Leads to health hazards and climate change
- Results in soil nutrient loss
- Farmers lack real-time guidance and economic clarity

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An intelligent decision-support platform that:
- Recommends alternatives to stubble burning
- Compares profit vs burning
- Connects farmers with residue buyers
- Provides government subsidy information
- Supports voice-based interaction for ease of use

---

## 🚀 Key Features
- 🌱 Crop residue alternative recommendation system
- 💰 Economic analysis & break-even estimation
- 🧾 Sell crop residue module
- 🧑‍🌾 Buyer discovery system
- 🎙️ Voice assistant for farmers
- 🌐 Multilingual translation support
- 🌍 Soil health impact analysis
- 🏛️ Government subsidy awareness
- 🎥 Educational videos for guidance
