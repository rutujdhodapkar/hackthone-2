# 🌾 AI-Powered Crop Residue & Stubble Burning Alternative Advisor


::contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}


## 📌 Overview
Stubble burning is a major environmental, health, and agricultural issue. This project presents an **AI-powered advisory system** that helps farmers shift from burning crop residue to **profitable and sustainable alternatives** such as composting, biochar production, pelletization, and residue selling.

The platform is built using **Streamlit and Python** and provides **economic analysis, soil health insights, buyer discovery, subsidy awareness, and voice-based assistance** in a farmer-friendly interface.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
- Open-field stubble burning causes severe air pollution (PM2.5, smog)
- Leads to respiratory diseases and climate change
- Degrades soil nutrients and fertility
- Farmers lack real-time guidance and market connectivity

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution
An intelligent decision-support platform that:
- Recommends eco-friendly alternatives to stubble burning
- Compares burning vs alternative profitability
- Connects farmers with crop residue buyers
- Provides government subsidy and policy information
- Supports voice-based and multilingual interaction
